The exact solution depends on the underlying cause, which is difficult to pinpoint due to the vague nature of the error message. However, a systematic approach can help:

1. **Thoroughly Examine Build Logs:** Look past the generic error message. The build system often produces detailed logs that might indicate the real cause of the failure.  Look for specific errors within those logs. 
2. **Update Expo CLI:** `expo upgrade` may resolve issues with older versions. 
3. **Verify Android Studio Setup:** Ensure Android Studio and its components (SDK, NDK, etc.) are correctly configured and up-to-date. 
4. **Clean Build:** Try cleaning your build directory. This removes any potentially corrupt files. 
5. **Check Network Connectivity:** Intermittent network issues can disrupt the build process. Ensure you have stable internet access. 
6. **Gradle Issues:** Gradle (Android's build system) can be the root of build problems. Check for Gradle errors in the logs. Consider adjusting Gradle settings such as memory allocations or daemon settings in the gradle.properties file.
7. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** conflicting dependencies can cause cryptic build failures. Examine package.json for any issues.
8. **Run on a different machine:** Sometimes the issue may relate to a specific environment. Testing on another machine might provide insights.
