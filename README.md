# Expo CLI Android Build Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo CLI where the Android build process fails with a generic error message, providing little to no information about the cause of the failure. This makes debugging extremely difficult.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo build:android`.
4. Observe the vague error message indicating build failure. 

## Solution

The solution is to carefully review logs. It may require investigation into build tools configurations, Gradle issues, or other underlying problems. Examine the console for more specific errors that may have been missed. Some common fixes are:
* Updating the Expo CLI
* Checking for issues with Android Studio configuration
* Ensuring proper setup of Android SDK and NDK 
* Manually inspecting the log files from the build output
